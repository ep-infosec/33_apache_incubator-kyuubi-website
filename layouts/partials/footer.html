        <span class="footerSep"> Apache Kyuubi is an effort undergoing Incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator. 
        Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, 
        communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
        While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, 
        it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
