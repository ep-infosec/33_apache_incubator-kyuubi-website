The Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) for Apache Kyuubi
has invited [Shaoyun Chen](https://github.com/cxzl25) to become our committer
and we are pleased to announce that he has accepted.

Shaoyun is currently working for Trip.com.

He has contributed to multiple modules of the Apache Kyuubi since last
year including:

- Implement dedicated set/get catalog/database operators
- Add adapter layer in Kyuubi Hive JDBC module
- Make ProcessBuilder.commands immutable
- Redact secret information from ProcBuilder log
- kyuubi-ctl some optimizations and added documentation
- Participate in discussions and development Spark TPC-DS Connector
- Investigate and fix multiple flaky tests

He has introduced Apache Kyuubi V1.4.0 to Trip.com as a multi-tenant
SQL engine for Spark3, running a large number of Ad-Hoc queries every
day.
He found and fixed some bugs encountered in the production
environment, and also implemented some optimizations.

Please join me in congratulating Shaoyun!

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
A PPMC member helps manage and guide the direction of the project.
