The Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) for Apache Kyuubi
has invited [Zhen Wang](https://github.com/wForget) to become our committer
and we are pleased to announce that he has accepted.

Zhen contributed to several modules in Kyuubi consistently over 6 months,
including both the Kyuubi server and Spark SQL engine.

The enhancements he made to Kyuubi server:
- Added connection concurrency limit to kyuubi server
- Added the digest Zookeeper authentication mode to the service discovery
  module
- Optimized orphan engine related issues

The features and enhancements he made to Spark SQL engine:
- Implemented a history server plugin of Kyuubi to Spark
- Implemented the execution progress of Spark SQL statements
- Supported single session mode of the Spark SQL engine
- Participated in the discussion and optimization of the engine pool.

He also helps review other developers' pull requests actively in the community.

Please join me in congratulating Zhen!

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
A PPMC member helps manage and guide the direction of the project.
