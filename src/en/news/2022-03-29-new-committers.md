The Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) for Apache Kyuubi
has invited [Nicholas Jiang](https://github.com/SteNicholas) &
[Fu Chen](https://github.com/cfmcgrady) to become our committers and
we are pleased to announce that they both have accepted.

Nicholas's been working in many areas of the Kyuubi community, especially
in the Flink SQL engine, he plays an important role in implementation,
promotion and Q&A of the Kyuubi Flink SQL engine.

Fu contributed to several modules in Kyuubi consistently over 6 months,
including Spark engine, Spark engine extension, Kyuubi server restful api and
Kyuubi infrastructure. He also helps review other developers' pull requests
actively in the community.

Please join me in congratulating Nicholas & Fu!

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
A PPMC member helps manage and guide the direction of the project.
